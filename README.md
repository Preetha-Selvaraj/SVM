# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains resources for a tutorial on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a popular supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The tutorial demonstrates how SVM works, the core concepts behind it, and what makes SVM special, along with various plots and visualizations to aid understanding. It showcases SVMâ€™s functionality with the Iris dataset and synthetic data generation and provides code to replicate and expand on the tutorial content.

The tutorial includes:
- A video presentation
- A PowerPoint file
- A complete transcript of the video
- Code used for the demonstrations in the tutorial

## Contents
1. **[Tutorial Video](#tutorial-video)**  
   A 10-minute video tutorial explaining SVMs, their working mechanism, and practical applications.  
   
2. **[Transcript](#transcript)**  
   The full-text transcript of the tutorial video.  
   
3. **[PowerPoint Presentation](#powerpoint-presentation)**  
   A slide deck used in the video, summarizing key points.  
   
4. **[Code](#code)**  
   A Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step code examples, including:  
   - Importing and preprocessing a dataset  
   - Training an SVM model  
   - Visualization & model evaluation  
   
5. **[Figures and Visualizations](#figures-and-visualizations)**  
   Generated plots and figures to illustrate key concepts like decision boundaries, support vectors, and kernel effects.
